## Changelog

### Enemy Level Randomizer v1.4
Adjusted tooltips to hopefully be more self explanatory. This will reset your settings.    
Limited sliders to 50 to make them more usable. You should be able to manually edit the settings file if you want higher.

### Enemy Level Randomizer v1.3
Updated to use some of the new features from SDK version 0.7.8.    
Most notably, the enabled state is now saved over game launches.

### Enemy Level Randomizer v1.2
Fixed issues with level clamping that could cause enemies to keep their original level if their randomized one went below 0 or above 255.
Removed the level 255 maximum.

### Enemy Level Randomizer v1.1
Updated for SDK versions 0.7.4-0.7.6.

### Enemy Level Randomizer v1.0
Inital Release.
