# Command Extensions
Adds a few new console commands, and provides functionality for other mods to do the same. All these
commands are fully compatible with blcmm files, you can just put them in your mod and have users
merge it with other files and enable/disable various categories and it all just keeps working fine.

[See here for info on the builtin commands and how to write mods using them.](Writing-Mods.md)

### Multiplayer Compatability
Multiplayer compatability largely depends on the exact mod making use of this. Some commands are
simply incompatibly with multiplayer, anything relying on them too much will not work. Like always,
all players should make sure to be running the exact same set of mods, even more so than normally.

### Why does it take longer to `exec` my mods now?
This mod has to look through your mod file to handle the extra commands. This has to be done before
the game looks through it, which just takes some extra, unavoidable, time. You can speed it up by
making your mod file smaller - enable structural edits then delete any categories you don't have
enabled (and won't suddenly re-enable soon).

## Changelog

### Command Extensions v1.7
Added the `exec_raw` command.    
Added the `--list` argument to the `load_package` command.

### Command Extensions v1.6
Moved file parsing to a native module - `exec`ing large mod files should now be faster.    
Added the `chat` command.    
Deprecated the `set_material` command.

### Command Extensions v1.5
Added the `unlock_package` command.    
Added the `--undo` optional argument to `keep_alive`.    
The `clone` and `clone_bpd` commands now set the `ObjectArchetype` field to whatever the source
object used, rather than having it reference the source object directly.

### Command Extensions v1.4
The `clone` and `clone_bpd` commands now output an error if the target already exists, and don't try
to clone it again. This error message can be suppressed with an optional argument.    
Fixed handling of `exec` commands when using files outside of Binaries.    
Add support for the sdk's builtin `py` and `pyexec` commands to blcmm files. Also explicitly raise
errors when a mod tries to unregister these, which never worked properly in the first place.    
Cleanup handling of subclasses so they're less likely to break if you start trying to create custom
classes.

### Command Extensions v1.2 + v1.3
Added the `set_early` command.

### Command Extensions v1.1
Added the `CE_Debug`, `clone_bpd`, and `set_material` commands.    
Explicitly raise errors when a mod tries to register `set` or unregister `CE_EnableOn` - neither of
these worked properly in the first place.    
Switched the demo mod file to "online" mode.

### Command Extensions v1.0
Inital Release.
