## Changelog


### Alt Use Vendors v1.6
Added more optimization in anticipation of sdk version 0.7.10. Will fall back to current implementation when running on older versions.

### Alt Use Vendors v1.5
Optimized a lot of the code - should help anyone who was having stutters.    
As the description mentions (and has for a bit), if you're still having stutters, disable the updating costs option.

### Alt Use Vendors v1.4
Updated to use some of the new features from SDK version 0.7.8.    
Most notably, the enabled state is now saved over game launches.    
Fixed that the "can't afford" warning was not shown when updating costs was off.

### Alt Use Vendors v1.3
Fixed crashes caused by enabling this mod then exiting the game - it didn't actually affect anything but people kept asking.

### Alt Use Vendors v1.2
Now opens a webpage listing requirements when you don't install them all.

### Alt Use Vendors v1.1
Made vendor prices only update while a player is near them, which should be more lag friendly.    
Also added an option to disable vendor price updating entirely - you won't see the prices anymore, but it should be even more lag friendly.    

### Alt Use Vendors v1.0
Initial Release.
